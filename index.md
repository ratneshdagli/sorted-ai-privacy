# SortMate AI – PRIVACY POLICY

**Effective Date:** January 21, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 21, 2026

---

## 1. INTRODUCTION

SortMate AI ("we," "our," or "the App") is a 100% local-first productivity assistant that automatically converts messages from supported chat apps into actionable draft tasks and calendar events—all processed entirely on your device with zero cloud uploads.

**Our Core Privacy Commitment:**

✅ **100% On-Device Processing** – All AI analysis happens locally on your phone  
✅ **Zero Server Communication** – Your data never leaves your device  
✅ **No Off-Device Data Collection** – We do not collect or transmit data off-device  
✅ **Military-Grade Encryption** – All local data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM  
✅ **Automatic Deletion** – Old messages are automatically purged (7/30/90 days or custom)  
✅ **Complete Transparency** – You control everything; we control nothing

This Privacy Policy explains:  
* How the App processes data locally on your device  
* Why we need specific permissions (Accessibility Service, Calendar)  
* How your data is encrypted and automatically deleted  
* What we do NOT do with your information

---

## 2. WHAT DATA IS PROCESSED (LOCALLY ONLY)

### 2.1 Message Text (On-Device Only)

**What the App Does:** When you enable the Accessibility Service, SortMate AI reads message text directly from supported messaging apps to detect tasks, events, and reminders.

**Examples of Processing:** * "Meeting kal 3 baje" → Draft Event: "Meeting Tomorrow 3:00 PM"  
* "Pay Rohit 500 for dinner" → Draft Payment Reminder: ₹500 to Rohit  
* "Gym roz subah 6 baje" → Recurring Task: "Gym Daily 6:00 AM"  
* "Har Monday standup 10am" → Weekly Event: "Standup Every Monday 10:00 AM"

**How It Works:**

1.  **Reading:** The App uses Android's Accessibility Service API to read text content from chat messages.
2.  **Analysis:** Message text is analyzed using on-device AI (no internet required).
3.  **Extraction:** Relevant information is extracted (date, time, person, amount, recurrence pattern).
4.  **Draft Creation:** A draft suggestion is created and shown to you for review.
5.  **Your Control:** You must manually Confirm, Edit, or Dismiss each draft—nothing happens automatically.

**Storage & Encryption:**

* Message text is stored in a local encrypted database (AES-256-GCM encryption).
* Encryption keys are managed by Android Keystore (hardware-backed security).
* Field-level encryption protects message content, sender information, and metadata.
* Data is inaccessible to other apps (stored in app-private directory).
* **Never uploaded to any server or cloud service.**

**Automatic Deletion:** Messages are automatically deleted after your chosen retention period:
* 7 days (default)
* 30 days
* 90 days
* Custom (minimum 2 days)

Deletion is enforced through daily scheduled cleanup that permanently removes expired data.

---

### 2.2 Calendar Events

**What the App Does:** If you grant Calendar permission, SortMate AI can:
1.  Read your existing calendar events to detect scheduling conflicts.
2.  Write events to your calendar only when you explicitly tap "Confirm" on a draft.

**Examples:**
* **Conflict Detection:** "Meeting at 3 PM conflicts with existing Gym appointment."
* **Event Creation:** Tapping "Confirm" on a draft adds it to your default calendar.

**Storage:**
* Calendar data is accessed through Android's Calendar Provider API.
* We do not store copies of your calendar events.
* Calendar access is read-only until you confirm a draft.

**Your Control:**
* You can use the App without Calendar permission (drafts won't sync to calendar).
* Each draft requires your explicit confirmation before writing to calendar.
* No auto-sync, no background changes.

---

### 2.3 App Preferences (Local Only)

**What Is Stored:**
* Permission status (Accessibility enabled/disabled, Calendar enabled/disabled).
* Message retention period (7/30/90 days or custom).
* Onboarding completion status.
* UI preferences (language, theme settings).

**Storage Location:**
* Android SharedPreferences (local device storage).
* Never transmitted to external servers.

---

### 2.4 What We DO NOT Collect

The App does not collect, access, or process:

❌ **Location data** – No GPS or location tracking  
❌ **Contacts** – No access to your contact list

❌ **Network data** – No IP addresses or network requests with user data  
❌ **Behavioral data** – No usage analytics, screen recordings, or tracking  
❌ **Keyboard input** – No keystroke logging outside supported chat messages  
❌ **Audio/Video** – No microphone or camera access  
❌ **Financial data** – No credit card or payment information

We do not use:

## 3. HOW DATA IS PROCESSED

### 3.1 Core Functionality (On-Device AI)

**Processing Workflow:** 1.  **Message Reading:** Accessibility Service reads text from supported chat apps.
2.  **Local Analysis:** On-device AI analyzes the text (Hinglish and English supported).
3.  **Pattern Detection:** Identifies dates ("kal," "parso"), times ("3 baje"), recurrence ("roz," "har hafte").
4.  **Draft Generation:** Creates a draft card with extracted information.
5.  **User Review:** You see the draft and choose to Confirm/Edit/Dismiss.
6.  **Optional Calendar Sync:** If confirmed, the event is written to your calendar.

**Processing Location:**
* All AI processing happens on your device's CPU/GPU.
* No network requests are made for message analysis.
* Works 100% offline (airplane mode compatible).

---

### 3.2 Conflict Detection

If Calendar permission is granted:
1.  The App reads your existing calendar events.
2.  Compares draft event times with existing appointments.
3.  Warns you: "Meeting at 3 PM conflicts with Gym at 3 PM."

**Privacy Note:**
* Calendar reading is on-demand (only when reviewing a draft).
* No calendar data is stored permanently.
* No calendar data is transmitted externally.

---

### 3.3 Data Retention & Auto-Deletion

**Automatic Cleanup:**
* Daily scheduled task runs to delete expired messages.
* Deletion is based on your chosen retention period.
* Once deleted, data is permanently removed (not recoverable).

**Manual Deletion:** You can delete all data anytime:
1.  Open **Settings → Data & Privacy**.
2.  Tap **"Clear All Data"**.
3.  Confirm deletion.

This permanently removes:
* All stored message text.
* All draft cards.
* All app preferences.

---

## 4. PERMISSIONS EXPLAINED

### 4.1 Accessibility Service ⚠️ (Primary Permission)

**Why We Need It:** Android restricts apps from reading content from other apps. To detect tasks and events from your chats, we use the Accessibility Service API to read message text directly from the chat app's interface.

**What We Do:** ✅ Read text content from supported chat messages  
✅ Analyze text locally using on-device AI  
✅ Create draft suggestions for you to review  
✅ Process only supported chat apps (no other apps monitored)  
✅ Respect user control (you must confirm each draft manually)

**What We Do NOT Do:** ❌ Control chat apps or send messages on your behalf  
❌ Auto-confirm drafts (you must manually tap "Confirm")  
❌ Record keystrokes or passwords  
❌ Monitor banking apps, browsers, or other sensitive apps  
❌ Access chat media (photos, videos, voice notes)  
❌ Upload message text to any server or cloud service  
❌ Share data with third parties

**Scope Limitation:** * Accessibility Service is used exclusively for reading chat message text.
* We do not monitor screen content from other apps.
* We do not capture UI events outside supported chat apps.
* We do not use Accessibility to perform actions (clicks, gestures) on your behalf.

**Compliance:** We comply with Google Play's Accessibility API Policy, which permits Accessibility Service usage for productivity features that help users organize information.

**Transparency:**
* Permission rationale is shown before requesting access.
* You can disable Accessibility anytime in Settings.
* Disabling it stops new draft creation but preserves existing drafts.

---

### 4.2 Calendar Permission

**Why We Need It:** To show your existing events for conflict detection and to write confirmed drafts to your calendar.

**What We Do:** ✅ Read calendar events via Android's Calendar Provider API  
✅ Write events only after your explicit confirmation  
✅ Detect scheduling conflicts before creating events

**What We Do NOT Do:** ❌ Modify existing events without your permission  
❌ Delete calendar events  
❌ Auto-sync drafts (you must confirm each one)  
❌ Access calendar data from other apps or accounts

**Your Control:**
* Calendar permission is entirely optional.
* You can use the App without Calendar access (drafts remain local).
* Each calendar write requires your explicit tap on "Confirm".

---

## 5. DATA SECURITY
