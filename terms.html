    <section>
      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By downloading, installing, or using SortMate AI ("the App"), you agree to these Terms &amp; Conditions. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, do not install or use the App.</p>

      <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>SortMate AI is a productivity application that analyzes message text on your device to suggest draft tasks and calendar events. These suggestions are drafts only and require your review and confirmation.</p>

      <h2>2.1 No Affiliation with Third Parties</h2>
      <p>SortMate AI is an independent productivity tool. It is not affiliated with, associated with, authorized by, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with any third-party messaging app provider. Any third-party names, logos, and trademarks are the property of their respective owners and are used only for identification purposes.</p>

      <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must use the App in compliance with applicable laws and third-party terms of service.</li>
        <li>You should respect the privacy and rights of other people when using message ingestion features.</li>
        <li>Do not use the App for illegal, malicious, or harmful activities.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for verifying suggestions produced by the App before acting on them.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>AI Limitations:</strong> You acknowledge that the App uses artificial intelligence and probabilistic models which may produce inaccurate, incomplete, or unexpected results. The App’s suggestions (tasks, events, reminders) are drafts only. You are solely responsible for reviewing and confirming the accuracy of dates, times, amounts, and details before taking any real-world action (such as making payments or scheduling appointments).</p>

      <h2>4. Permissions and Device Features</h2>

      <h2>4.1 Use of Accessibility Services</h2>
      <p>If you choose to enable message ingestion, the App may use Android Accessibility Services to read on-screen text that is displayed in supported messaging apps, for the sole purpose of detecting potential tasks and events and creating draft suggestions.</p>
      <p>You can use the App without enabling Accessibility Services. You can revoke Accessibility permission at any time in your device settings, which will stop new message ingestion.</p>

      <h2>4.2 Calendar Access</h2>
      <p>If you choose to enable calendar access, the App may read your device calendar to help detect conflicts and may write events only when you explicitly confirm a draft (where supported by your device and permissions).</p>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>The App, including its design, interface, branding, and content (excluding third-party open-source libraries), is the exclusive property of SortMate AI and its developers. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial use.</p>

      <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
      <p>Your use of the App is governed by our Privacy Policy. Please review it here:

        </a>
      </p>

      <h2>7. No Warranties</h2>
      <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, WORK ON ALL DEVICES, OR BE ERROR-FREE. YOU USE THE APP AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SORTMATE AI AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MISSED APPOINTMENTS, LOST DATA, OR LOST PROFITS.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will indicate the "Last updated" date above. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it. We may suspend or terminate access to the App for users who violate these Terms.</p>

      <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of India, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Any disputes arising under these Terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in India.</p>
